1. The Law of Car: The primitive car is defined only for non-empty lists.
2. The Law of Cdr: he primitive cdr is defined only fo rnon-empty lists. The cdr of any non-empty list is always another list.
3. The Law of Cons: The Primitive cons takes two arguments. The second argument to cons must be a list. The result is a list.
4. The Law of Null?: The primitive null? is defined only for lists.
5. The Law of Eq?: The primitive eq? takes two arguments. Each must be a non-empty numeric atom.
6. The First Commandment(preliminary): Always ask null? as the first question in expressing any function.
7. The Second Commandment: Use cons to build lists.
8. The Third Commandment: When building a list, describe the first typical element, and then cons it onto the natural recursion.
